# U.S. Pharmaceutical Market Overview: Drug-Condition-Gene Associations Analysis

This exploratory drug-condition-gene investigation aims to identify key trends, commonalities, and possible underlying factors to the current drug offerings on the pharmaceutical market. By not only connecting drugs with their target conditions, but connecting said conditions with genetic contributors, this study identifies potential underlying reasons behind patient favorability of certain drugs. Inversely, key trends and commonalities in drugs may lend insights into poor patient satisfaction for clusters of drugs and subsequent, connected conditions. This study and its findings serves as a market overview of the pharmaceutical industry, instructing further research into overlooked conditions and improved drug formulation. In an increasingly patient-centric healthcare system, pharmaceutical formulation must take into account patient experiences and perceptions of their treatment options.
